Greetings all,
    This is our instructions manual to ensure the best experience of our version of fantastic GUI.
We simply thought out of the box and asked : why not create an interface that operates by VOICE COMMAND? 
We used an external library called sphinx4 and that allows us to create a dictionary of words that we can use
throughout the game. This library uses the devices's microphone.
Our words were: Move up/down/left/right.
                           Attack up/down/left/right
                           Cast Ability
                           Use Leader Ability
                           End Turn

***VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: This external library has to be downloaded on each device seperately, meaning that the game WILL NOT
             WORK without downloading the libraries on the device. 
             Kindly, follow the steps shown in this video from 2:25 to 3:25 and remove the existing external JARs

***Note: Please wear your headphones to prevent the music of the game itself to interfere with the command words
              given to the microphone.

***Note: The microphone is very sensitive, so - sometimes - you might need to say your command again.


Run the "PlayerNames" class in "view" package and enjoy the show!
