This games's idea is to implement a 2D Strategy Marvel-based game that uses Voice Commands to control the game using Java. 

This is an Academic project that focuses on the concepts of Object Oriented Programming for the purpose of learning how to properly create object classes with their respective attributes, creating superclasses and their subclasses & learning how to make different objects interact with each other to produce the final result.

## Brief Description
This is a 2 player strategy game. Each player picks 3 champions to form his team and fight the other player’s team. The players take turns to fight the other player’s champions.

The turns will keep going back and forth until a player is able to defeat all of the other player’s
champions which will make him the winner of the battle.

During the battle, each player will use his champions to attack the opponent champions either
by using normal attacks or using special attacks/abilities. 

The battle takes place on a 5x5 grid.
Each cell in the grid can either be empty, or contain a champion or obstacle/cover. At the
beginning of the battle, each team will stand at one of the sides/edges of the grid as a starting
position.

The turns will keep passing over the living champions till a player is able to defeat all of the
three champions of the opponent player. In this case, the game ends and the player with the
living champion will be declared the winner.
